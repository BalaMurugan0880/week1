<p><strong>Ampang's</strong> history is closely related to the history of <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>. In 1857, <em>Raja Abdullah</em>, a representative of the <strong>Selangor</strong> Sultanate, opened up the <strong>Klang Valley</strong> for tin mining. 87 Chinese miners from Lukut went up the river <strong>Klang</strong> and landed at <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>, then walked for a few miles through a jungle path to <strong>Ampang</strong> and began prospecting in the <strong>Ampang</strong> area. However, within a month 69 of the 87 miners had died due to the malarial conditions of the area, and <em>Raja Abdullah</em> sent another 150 men to continue the work. Eventually the death rate dropped, and the first tin was exported in 1859. The success of tin mining at <strong>Ampang</strong> led to the development of <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>. The name <strong>"Ampang"</strong> means "dam" in Malay and the place was named in reference to the miners' dams.</p>

<p>There are many pre-war buildings along <strong>Ampang</strong> Road. The <em>Eng Choon Assembly Hall</em> on <strong>Ampang</strong> Road for example was built in 1930. Its inner structure was rebuilt to support a taller building within.<em> Eu Tong Sen</em>, a leading businessman in the early 1900s, built a villa in 1935 on <strong>Ampang</strong> Road.The same location was used by the <em>British government</em> as a military base. Over time it was renovated and reopened as the <em>National Art Gallery</em> on 27 August 1958 and much later refurbished to become the <em>Malaysia Tourism Centre (MaTiC)</em>. <em>Eu Tong Sen</em> also owned a tin mine in <strong>Ampang</strong> which was the first to install an electricity generator in 1914.</p>
